# BuildBox

## VirtualBox by Vagrant
Creates a VirtualBox machine with Debian 11 - Bullseye 64-bit, provisioned
for kernel development, Yocto, Buildroot and stuff like that :-)

Assuming you have vagrant installed.

First edit config.yaml to set resources and shared folder.

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

Or just log in from VirtualBox.
